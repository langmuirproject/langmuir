Furthermore, you should cite the works behind each model you use:

- For OML theory cite [MottSmith]_ for Maxwellian plasmas, or if you use Kappa-Cairns distributed plasmas, [Darian]_.
- For finite-radius models cite [Laframboise]_ for Maxwellian plasmas, or if you use Kappa-Cairns distributed plasmas, [Darian]_.
- For finite-length models cite [Marholm]_.
