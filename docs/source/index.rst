.. TODO:
    - Finite-length:
        - Include some theory on profile functions and interpolation     
        - Example of current profile, and how to use current profile demo
        - New demo on IV-characteristics with guard and FL-theory
    - Finite-radius:
        - Proper explanation of different tables
    - Tutorial on IV-characteristics and how to compute beta
    - Tutorial on inverse problems
    - Finding the floating potential
