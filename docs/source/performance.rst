Performance
===========
As of now Langmuir is written almost exclusively without concern for execution speed. The function ``finite_length_current()`` has been optimized once, which resulted in a factor 50 speed-up. Further optimizations of similar magnitude is probably within reach, but will not be carried out unless deemed necessary. If you need this, please open an issue on GitHub.
