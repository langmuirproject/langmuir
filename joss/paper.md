# Summary

Langmuir probes are among the most common instruments for measuring plasma
parameters such as the electron density and the electron temperature in space
and laboratory plasma devices [@tbd:3000]. The instrument works by immersing a
conductor of a certain voltage in a plasma (e.g., the ionosphere), and
measuring the current (charged particles) collected from the plasma. Since the
current depend on the plasma parameters, it is in principle possible to infer
plasma parameters from a set of such measurements at different voltages.

Traditionally, the current--voltage characteristic $I(V)$ (current as function
of voltage) for such instruments is derived by means of analytical theories
such as the *orbital motion-limited* (OML) theory [@tbd:3000]. Such theories
make several simplifying assumptions, for instance that cylindrical probes be
infinitely long. With the advent of computer simulations, it is possible to
simulate characteristics with fewer restrictions. However, simulation results
are usually tables of numerical values rather than mathematical expressions.
